Hello, Internet. It's been a while since I have posted anything here - precisely 1,634 days or 53.68 months - but I am back. A lot has happened during this time; some notable events include:

- I moved countries twice
- Worked at 2 of my dream companies
- Left both of those companies
- Solved my immigration puzzle, enabling me to finally start a company
- Joined SPC, created a [company](https://www.studiolanes.com), and started working with my co-founder

And here we are. During these 1,634 days, I've encountered many interesting experiences and insights. I've decided to resume writing on this blog to share these experiences and thoughts with you, one small piece at a time. If you resonate with or learn something new from these pieces, fantastic. If not, I encourage you to message me on [X](https://x.com/guard_if). Let's have a pleasant conversation and enlighten each other.


As a prelude to upcoming posts, here's a sample of topics and thoughts currently on my mind:


- Startups can take many forms. What is the ideal form that I want to create and nurture with a co-founder?
- If ideas are seeds, what is my preferred approach to produce, nurture, and grow them into self-sustaining & profitable entities?
- The AI golden age is here. What will living in the future look like? How can I ride the wave of this exciting technology?
- and more...


Before I go, here are some quotes that deeply resonated with me.

> It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause;

> â€œTurning something from an idea into a reality can make it seem smaller.
> It changes from unearthly to earthly.
> The imagination has no limits. The physical world does.
> The work exists in both.
