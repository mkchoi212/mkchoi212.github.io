Hello, Internet. It's been awhile since I have posted anything here - precisely 1,634 days or 53.68 months - but I am back. A lot has happened during this time but some notable events are

- I moved countries twice
- Worked at 2 of my dream companies
- Quit working from both of those companies
- Figured out my immigration puzzle so I can finally start a company
- Joined SPC, created a [company](https://www.studiolanes.com), and started working with my co-founder

And here we are. For 1,634 days, I have seen, heard, experienced, created, and tasted a lot of interesting nuggets the world has to offer. The decision to resume writing on this blog is motivated by me wanting to share these nuggets and thoughts to you all, one small bite at a time. If you resonate or learn something new from the bite, fantastic. If you do not, I encourage you to message me on [X](https://x.com/guard_if). Let's have a nice conversation and enlighten each other.


So, as a prelude to the upcoming posts, here is an appetizer of topics and thoughts that are currently on top of my mind.


- Startups can take many forms. What is the ideal form that I want to create and nurture with a co-founder?
- If ideas are seeds, what is my preferred approach to produce, nuture, and grow seeds into self-sustaining & profitable entities?
- AI golden age is here. What does living in the future look like? How can I ride the wave of this exciting technology?
- and more...


Before I go, here are some quotes that deeply resonated with me.

> It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause;

> â€œTurning something from an idea into a reality can make it seem smaller.
> It changes from unearthly to earthly.
> The imagination has no limits. The physical world does.
> The work exists in both.
