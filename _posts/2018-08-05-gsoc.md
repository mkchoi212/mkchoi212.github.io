This summer, I participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/) with [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org/). My personal project was to establish the much needed test-suite for [VLCKit](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit), a generic multimedia library for audio or video playback needs on macOS, iOS and tvOS.

Before diving into the post, I would like to let you know that I will explain each pull request and why the said action was taken. This way, if you - the coherant reader - come by similar problems, you will know exactly what to do :D

# Premise

Before the project started, VLCKit was already available to the public via source code and [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/VLCKit). However, even with over 80,000 downloads, and over 5,000 activate applications relying on it, the repo lacked a test-suite. My GSoC project aimed to solve this by integrating a test-suite along with a continuous integration workflow that would act as a safety net for any potential breakages.

Before listing all of my contributions, I would like to note that while my main task was to establish the said test-suite, I also decided to contribute to other projects within VideoLAN during the coding period. You can read about them in the [second part]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2018-08-05-gsoc-2 %}) of the series.

# VLCKit TestSuite

Below is a list of pull requests that have been made throughout the GSoC coding period.

#### 1. [Add singular form for verbose time description](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/10)

To be honest, the big code base kinda scared me in the beginning. To overcome this, I went and looked for the **easiest, simplest looking class.** After a bit of searching, I found `VLCTime.h`, an `NSObject` that represented the.... time. While browsing through the code, I found that its `verboseTimeDescription:` function returned **1 minutes 20 seconds** instead of **1 minute 20 seconds**. It was really small but I had found my first bug ðŸŽ‰

With [@felix](https://twitter.com/feepk)'s suggestion, I used Apple's date component API. And voilÃ ! My first PR was merged.

#### 2. [Setup testing schemes in Xcode](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/11)

This was a simple PR setting up the testing scheme within Xcode. But the big lesson in this PR is this,

> A pull request should only **deal with ONE thing and ONE thing only.**

#### 3. [Tests: VLCTime](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/12)

This was the first PR that added tests to the codebase. After much discussion with my mentors, all tests written from this point followed the [blackbox](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/black-box-testing/) method of testing.

#### 4. [Create Rakefile](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/14)

I wanted a script to expedite the process of building and testing. After having used [fastlane](http://fastlane.tools) not long ago in VLC-iOS, my mind went immediately to it. But considering fastlane has something like 20 dependencies, [@caro](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N) thought that it would be too much when we were only going to use one of fastlane's many features.

I agreed and began to look for *lighter* solutions. I eventually came across [PSPDFKitSwift](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKitSwift) made by the good folks at PSPDFKit. In the repo, PSPDFKit uses a [Rakefile](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKitSwift/blob/master/Rakefile) to easily compile, and release the framework.

Inspired by this, I basically copied what they did... but with additional tasks for testing.

> Lesson here? Never be satisfied with option #1. Look at other options and you will probably be surprised :D

#### 5. [Setup CircleCI](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/15)

This was relatively easy thanks to CircleCI's thorough documentation. And with the `Rakefile` from the previous PR, `.circleci.yml` ended up looking clean.

#### 6. [Enable code coverage via xccov](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/16)

I previously had used code coverage services like [codecov](https://codecov.io) and [coveralls](http://coveralls.io). So, I suggested VLCKit use one of these services. But after [@caro](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N) mentioned that Apple had recently released `xccov`, a code coverage report generator, I ended up integrating it in the aforementioned `Rakefile`.

While xccov is very easy to integrate, its output is **too hard to read and not visually pleasing.**

To solve this, I decided to create a xccov prettifier called [xcperfect](https://github.com/mkchoi212/xcperfect). Hopefully it can become a part of VLCKit once it becomes stable enough.

#### 7. [Setup testing schemes for VLCKit](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/17)

Simple PR to setup Xcode schemes ðŸ˜µ

#### 8. [Setup testing schemes for TVVLCKitTests](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/18)

Once more ðŸ™ƒ

#### 9. [Tests: VLCMedia](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/19)

The test here cover simple in & out style function with no internal mutations. The tests may look un-eventful, but **make sure you cover all the edge cases. ðŸ˜Ž**

#### 10. [Tests: Add video samples](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/23)

The question here was,

> "How do we store test video assets in the repo?"

I will start by listing some of the options we considered and their pros & cons.

  1. Just store it in the repo
     - Pro: Easy
     - Con: Assets might get big and bloat the repo
  2. Git-LFS
     - Pro: Easy to setup and buying into Git's infra
     - Con: Github requires you to pay ðŸ’°
  3. Git-Submodules
     - Pro: Easy to setup and buying into Git's infra
     - Con: *"If you use git-submodules, you'll have a bad time"*
  4. Upload to server and download when building
     - Pro: Large reliable storage is available for FREE
     - Con: Relies on network to start initial test

And after consulting Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/guard_if/status/1022417680928653312) and [here](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N/status/1016293967787372544), we ended up with a combination of few options

> Create a new repo called **TestAssets** and clone it via a Shell script during Xcode project's initial build via RunBuildPhase.

#### 11. [Tests: VLCAudio](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/24)

`VLCAudio` contains numerous internal state mutations. After initial doubts of whether blackbox testing was going work, this pull request proved that blackbox testing is going to work just fine.

#### 12. [Project organization](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/25)

The most satisfying thing ever is when git tells you...

```
+31 **-980**
```

#### 13. [README: Reformat](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/26)

As [@caro](https://twitter.com/_Caro_N) would say,

> "People judge repositories by its... cover".

Inspired by Swift's Github repo, the README went through a major makeover.

#### 14. [README: Link build status badge with master](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/29)

To make the README even more attractive, a table with various status badges was added. This allows the users to immediately know the status of the repo along with the latest version of the framework.

#### 15. [VLCLibrary: debugLogging status (closes #186)](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/30)

When the user sets the `debugLoggingLevel/Status` of their `VLCLibrary` instance, no information was being saved nor checked. This PR fixed exactly that.

#### 16. [Tests: VLCLibrary](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/32)

This implements tests for `VLCLibrary` with the previous PR merged in. Tests here are pretty straightforward however, there are couple of functions that could not tested due their dependency on network calls.

#### 17. [VLCMediaThumbnailer: Update dimensions (fixes #183)](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/33)

This PR fixes a bug where the media thumbnail's dimensions are not updated internally.

#### 18. [VLCMediaList: removeMediaAt (closes #182)](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/34)

This PR fixes a bug detected via HockeyApp crash reports from the production release of VLC-iOS. There were many ways this bug could have been fixed. However, all methods shared a common theme

> An API shouldn't crash due to a potentially inconsistent state.

Think about this the next time you design your API.

#### 19. [Tests: VLCMediaList](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/35)

Table-driven tests for the win!

#### 20. [Tests: VLCMediaThumbnailer](https://github.com/videolan/vlckit/pull/37)

XCTest doing some major heavy lifting in this PR.

# Moving forward

There are still some test code that has not been pushed to the repository. To ensure that these get merged into the repo, I plan on keep submitting PRs to VLCKit in hopes to achieve 100% code coverage!
