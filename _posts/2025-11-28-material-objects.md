description: A list of material things that brought me joy this year
---

Sat at a coffee shop in Wichita, Kansas for Thanksgiving and I thought I'd write something that isn't an email, a Slack message, a line of code, or a comment on a Notion doc for once. So, as a proud consumer of the world, here's a list of material things that brought me joy this year.

### Small Coffee Cups

This year, I have been exploring new ways to drink coffee. I wanted it become more of a ritual than a habit. Small cups have been very helpful with this process. They slow things down. They ask you to pay attention to the drug you are ingesting.

The [two](https://www.orea.uk/sense-cup-150ml) [cups](https://kinto-usa.com/products/17144?variant=22206798463024) below feel almost like wine glasses. They hold the aroma in a way that invites you in. Before you take the sip, the cup first greets with you a pleasant scent.

Lately, I've been leaning into lighter, funkier, juicier coffees. Turns out they get even tastier as they start to cool. These small cups help with that.

    <h3>Contax T2</h3>
    <p>This thing is built like a tank. But takes photos that feel delicate and precise.</p>
    <p>Early this year, I dropped it on concrete while one too many pints in and wrapped the front cover. After a massive bill and a flight to Brooklyn, it's healthier than ever.. thankfully.</p>
    <p>Lesson learned that despite the titanium housing and me using the word "tank" to describe it 3 sentences ago, it still is a camera that is decades old and should be handled with maximum respect.</p>

    <h3>My Glasses</h3>
    <p>I've been wearing glasses since elementary school and I've genuinely only had two pairs that I LOVED. These are one of them.</p>
    <p>Made by a Korean brand, named lash | retrospect, they probably remind you of Moscots. But as an Asian, it's been very hard to find a pair of Moscots that fit me well. So think of these as Moscots, made by folks who have low nose bridges (Asians).</p>
    <p>They're sturdy and they almost act like horse blinders. They frame my peripheral vision and make me feel more focused and contained. The world is already too stimulating. These help narrow things just enough so I can stay present.</p>

    <h3>1461, Made in England</h3>
    <p>These boots make me feel ready for the day. I'm on my third pair of <a href="https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/1461-vintage-made-in-england-oxford-shoes-black/p/12877001">Docs</a> - same model - now. This time, I treated myself by getting the "Made in England" version of the boots.</p>
    <p>Breaking them in was tough. A few blisters. A few slow walks. I'm only a month in so it's too early to speak in absolutes. But so far, they feel sturdier than my "Made in China" boots.</p>
    <p>I almost strayed toward a pair of Solovairs, but the moment I put them on, my feet did not like them.</p>
    <p>For now, I'm sticking with the Docs.</p>

    <h3>The Coffee Scoop</h3>
    <p>This thing does one thing and it does it well. I use it every morning and the amount of joy <a href="https://kinto-usa.com/products/27672?variant=22206759665712">this tiny scoop</a> from Kinto has brought me is remarkable.</p>
    <p>It scoops the perfect amount of coffee beans and feels great to hold with two fingers. Its size lets me maneuver it into any coffee bag or storage opening.</p>
    <p>For me, this was a great reminder that material objects that bring you joy can be as simple as a scoop.</p>

    <h3>American Beaujolais</h3>
    <p>Yes, American Beaujolais is a thing. Made by a semi-controversial(??) winery Las Jaras, <a href="https://lasjaraswines.com/products/slipper-sippers">this thing</a> goes down like juice.</p>

    <h3>A Matter of Concrete</h3>
    <p>From packaging, to their bean selection, you can't go wrong with them. <a href="https://amatterofconcrete.com/product/pinkbourbon/">Pink bourbon</a> is their specialty. If you are in SF, you can sometimes find them at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CfabnCSEbgHa2LRAA">The Coffee Movement</a>.</p>

    <h3>Glow-in-the-Dark Nalgene Bottle</h3>
    <p>Hello fellow hydration homies. I discovered that Nalgene makes a <a href="https://museumstore.sfmoma.org/products/sfmoma-glow-green-bottle?variant=45668272930994">glow-in-the-dark bottle</a> a couple years ago, and I've never looked back.</p>
    <p>This thing looks great during the day. But it truly shines - ha - at night. Leave it beside your bed and it acts as a tiny beacon of light that helps you find your way back after using the restroom in the middle of the night.</p>

    <h3>The Weekender Bag</h3>
    <p>I daily drive <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/classic-duffel">this bag</a> and it fits everything I needs to carry. Sneakers, dirty gym clothes, a protein shake that doesn't smell great, emergency Vitamin C pills, and a laptop. The only downside is that people keep asking what I'm hauling around in a huge bag.</p>
    <p>Whenever they do, I give a cheeky "you wouldn't want to know - winky face" and it always turns into a fun conversation starter.</p>

    <h3>The Perfect White T-shirt</h3>
    <p>Every guy is probably always looking for the "perfect white t-shirt". For me, <a href="https://www.merzbschwanen.com/products/sturdy-jersey-t-shirt-side-seams-6-8oz-sq-yd-cropped-classic-fit-1">this is it</a>.</p>
    <p>Merz B. Shwanen is a brand that became famous thanks to the TV show "The Bear" and I have to admit it, I fell for the hype. But I am glad I did. There, I said it.</p>
    <p>The German attention to detail and their pride in making physical things well really comes through here.</p>
