My name is Mike JS. Choi; JS is for Jun Soo. I am the co-founder of [Koah](https://koahlabs.com).

I build things and write about software development when I have the time.
Check out some of my [projects](https://deadbeef.me/projects/) and my [blog posts](https://deadbeef.me).

## The Website

The site's title `0xdeadbeef` is a [hexspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak) I used a lot while I was building [bitbuf](https://github.com/mkchoi212/bitbuf).

This site was made on an [Apple MBP](https://www.apple.com/) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
